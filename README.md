# Landmark Router Program


## Introduction
Vancouver’s public metro system has asked you to help create a program to help commuters get from one landmark to another. You’ll be building out “SkyRoute,” a routing tool that uses breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Python dictionaries to accomplish this feat. For the purposes of this project, you can assume that it takes the same amount of time to get from each station to each of its connected neighboring stations.

## Specifications
This program runs on the terminal with Python.

## Installation
- Make sure Git is installed.
- Make sure Python is installed.
- Clone the repository.
